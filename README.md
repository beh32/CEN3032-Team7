# Hangman
### Description
 In this game, users will try to guess the randomly chosen word before the Hangman gains all of his limbs.
### Gameplay and Instructions
When the game begins, users will be prompted with a certain number of blank spaces on the screen next to the entire English alphabet. It is the player's job to guess different letters to try to reveal the hidden word in the blank spaces. But be careful, the more wrong guesses, the more limbs are drawn on the Hangman! When the Hangman gains all of his limbs, he dies, and the game is lost.
